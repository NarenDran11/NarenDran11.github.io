    <h6 class="tagline" style="color:rgb(21, 22, 22); text-align: center; font-size: 20px;" >Materialising a manager's vision of having the processes in his organisation complied</h6>  


    <p class="tagline" >Every organisation has a set of policies and procedures 
    that needs to be followed at all times, and there are managers
     to ensure the same. However, many a time, these processes and
      procedures may be neglected due to various reasons. This can lead
       to minor or major implications for the institution. Process Compliance Monitoring (PCM) 
       is a type of monitoring service which helps the company management to ensure that these
        process and procedures are followed at all times. Unlike other monitoring services which 
        concentrate only on the technical aspects, PCM is more focused on the business processes 
        of the institution. Our PCM operators at our monitoring station continuously follow up 
        the concerned staff at your premises until a process or procedure has complied. In a situation
         where the staff is not willing to comply, the event will be automatically escalated to the 
         appropriate managers at your organization. Therefore, our PCM system can be your second 
         level of management that ensures everything is in order.</p>

    <p class="tagline">Anything that can be sensed electrically, electronically or mechanically 
        can be connected to our network access device (NAD) and be monitored by us. 
        We do a complete process compliance monitoring (PCM) bringing peace to your lives.​</p>
<h6 class="headline"  style="color:rgb(21, 22, 22); text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Can our system fail?</h6>  
<p class="tagline">
    To ensure the quality of our service, we have redundant back up systems
     from our monitoring site to the server end. We also have a backup monitoring
      station in Auckland, New Zealand. In case of an emergency, our entire monitoring 
      operation can be switched to New Zealand in less than 3.5 minutes. Also, our 
       software will be constantly monitoring the health status of all the sensors and
        other network hardware, and will immediately notify you if there are any faults 
        or failures in the entire system installed at the premises
</p>

<h6 class="headline" style="color:rgb(21, 22, 22); text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">How well do you know?</h6>  
<p class="tagline">
    As each situation can be different, you can give standing
     instruction on whom to contact in case of an event. You can define 
     up to four levels of hierarchy, so if the designated person does not 
     attend our call, we will contact the next person from the list as specified by you.
      We can also deploy external guards, police or firefighters in case of an emergency
